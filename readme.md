How to run the code: All files needs to be placed in same folder. The code can be run from from any IDE directly or from console.
(i.e python main_ga.py)

There's 3 main files for 3 types of Algorithm
1) main_ga.py
2) main_alns.py
3) main_alns_farsight.py

By default, the code is configured to run "data-medium" dataset within "config.ini". This can be configured to "DEFAULT", "data-medium" or "data-complex" for different levels of complexity. 

There is an animation in the final output to display the results. The animation works well with VSCode.
For Spyder and Jupyter Notebook, need to uncomment "%matplotlib gt" in main_alns.py.
